# Image Processing for Evaluating Hydraulic Fracturing

This repository contains the resources for the article "Application of Image Processing in Evaluation of Hydraulic Fracturing with Liquid Nitrogen: A Case Study of Coal Samples from Karaganda Basin."

## Repository Structure

- `data`: Contains processed and raw images of coal samples before and after fracturing.
- `results`: Includes comparisons of processes and all other figures presented in the article.
- `get_stats.ipynb`: The main notebook that generates the figures in the results folder.
- `dilate_erode.py`: A script to execute the dilation and erosion morphological operations.
- `preprocess.py`: A script to run the image processing pipeline.
